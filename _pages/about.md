## About Me
I graduated with a Master of Arts in Applied Linguistics from Columbia University in May 2024. My research focuses on leveraging AI technologies for learning, language technology, and social good.

## Research Interests
  - *AI for Education*: personalized learning systems, language technology, multi-agent LLM systems
  - *Data Mining & NLP*: sentiment analysis, bias mitigation, contrastive learning
  - *AI for Social Good*: enhancing equity in education and addressing societal challenges
